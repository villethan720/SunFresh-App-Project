**ShipmentView** 

# How it Works
The shipment view screen displays a grid table displaying the total number of records in the database. It uses pagination to display the total number of records on each section. 

## The Search Bar
On the top of the gridview table, the user can search for a specific record based on any of the characteristics. 

## Home and Logout Buttons
The user can go back to the main homepage or logout at any time during the program.
